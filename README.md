# 📊 Clari+IQ — FinTech Landing Page

**Pronounced: "Clary plus I Que"**  
Clari+IQ is a smart, elegant FinTech landing page concept focused on delivering financial clarity and insight. Built with a clean design system, this project highlights UX strategy, visual design, and conversion-focused structure.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Simulate a SaaS product in the finance space
- Highlight UX/UI best practices and responsive design
- Demonstrate ability to create a brand, build a landing page, and guide users toward sign-up or pricing paths

## 🛠 Tech & Tools
- Webflow (built and deployed)
- Figma (wireframes + visual design)
- Relume (wireframe and sitemap starter)
- Photoshop (mockups and visual polish)
- ChatGPT + Gemini (for copy and concepting)

## 💡 Highlights
- Custom sitemap and conversion-focused layout

- Scroll-based animations and soft CTA hierarchy
- Modern visual style inspired by Rocket Money + Coinbase

## 🧠 Why It Stands Out
This project showcases the full-stack UX process—from brainstorming and wireframing to prototyping and building in Webflow. It’s designed to appeal to FinTech, SaaS, and marketing-focused companies.

This is a 100% original concept created as part of my design portfolio to demonstrate product thinking, visual polish, and real-world UX structure.
